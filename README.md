# ResNet

Ikomia plugin to launch inference on ResNet classification model. Inference can be made from pre-trained model on ImageNet dataset or from custom trained model. Indeed you can use the [Ikomia ResNextTrain plugin](https://github.com/Ikomia-dev/ResNetTrain) to make the training. This plugin is based on [PyTorch torchvision implementation](https://github.com/pytorch/vision).

### How to use it?
Here are the steps:

1. Create Ikomia account for free [here](https://ikomia.com/accounts/signup/) (if you don't have one)
2. Install [Ikomia software](https://ikomia.com/en/download)
3. Launch the software and log in with your credentials
4. Open Ikomia Store and install ResNet plugin
5. Open your images
6. Add ResNet algorithm to the workflow
7. Start the workflow and evaluate the prediction

That's it!
